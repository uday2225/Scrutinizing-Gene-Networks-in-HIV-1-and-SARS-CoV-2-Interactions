# Scrutinizing Gene Networks in HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Interactions

This repository contains the full project report and data for a computational biology study aimed at identifying druggable targets involved in **HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2** human interactions. It further predicts **bioactive compounds** capable of binding to common human receptors through **virtual screening** and **molecular docking**.

## 🧬 Project Overview

- **Institution**: National Institute of Technology, Warangal  
- **Academic Year**: 2021–2022  
- **Team Members**: Anjali Ankenapally, Apoorva Chivukula, Uday Kiran Gogineni  
- **Supervisor**: Dr. Soumya Lipsa Rath

## 🧪 Objective

- Analyze gene networks of human proteins that interact with HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.
- Use STRING database to identify protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.
- Perform virtual screening and docking of small molecule inhibitors using **PRinS** software.
- Identify compounds with strong docking scores and binding energies.

## 🔧 Tools & Databases Used

- STRING (protein-protein interaction analysis)
- UniProt, PDB (protein data)
- PRinS (molecular docking and visualization)
- ChEMBL (ligand data)

## 📊 Key Results

- Identified several potential druggable human targets within the CCR and CCL gene families.
- Conducted virtual screening on compounds for **CCL1**, **CCL16**, **CCL25**, **CCR2**, and **CCR8**.
- Top hit: `CHEMBL3647992` showed the **highest binding energy** with `CCL16`.
