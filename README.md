# Scrutinizing-Gene-Networks-in-HIV-1-and-SARS-CoV-2-Interactions
This repository contains the full project report and data for a computational biology study aimed at identifying druggable targets involved in HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 human interactions. It further predicts bioactive compounds capable of binding to common human receptors using virtual screening and molecular docking.
